Client achievements:
    The client no longer uses a global socket variable, instead it 
    passes it along as a parameter to follow better programming practices. 
    
Server achievements:
    I realized that the previous server would not send messages 
    to everyone as soon as they are received as a chat server 
    should, so I created a separate thread for message broadcasting.
    This means that multiple connected clients can both send and 
    receive messages simultaneously (yay!). 

This is also the last commit of the first day of binge programming 
this project.
