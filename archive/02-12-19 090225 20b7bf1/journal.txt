At this point in development, I was facing the issue of 
the client-side code not taking input very nicely.
I wanted the prompt on the last line of output, and messages
to be inserted above it. Over the next few commits up to this version,
I tried my very best to solve this issue. However, after many hours 
of fiddling and researching special escape characters, I realized
that it was more trouble than it was worth, considering this is 
a *networking* project. 

However, there was still a major change in terms of 
the protocol:

Starting off I had no clear vision of how the protocol should 
look, but in this iteration it took its form. I came up with 
the following message format for the application messages:
    {NICKNAME}: {MESSAGE}
The client sends a message like this, and the server simply 
echoes this out to all other connected clients.
