From the last version to this one, there was a lot of 
polishing of the code and a little change in functionality.

Server:
    The hello command is now a novelty command, it no longer
    is a part of the core protocol.


A list of minor changes include:
    Moving/removing whitespace
    Fixing command parsing (no more regex required!)
    Changing the nickname verification method to look nicer
    Switch all strings over to fstrings (Python 3)
    Remove input prompt since I could never keep things pretty anyway
