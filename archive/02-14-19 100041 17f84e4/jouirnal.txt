Client achievements:
    Added a mutex for writing to stdout (turns out sys.stdout.write
    is not thread safe).

    I added a keyword "later" that would indicate the client intends to 
    disconnect from the server. This is much more graceful than the 
    abrupt CTRL+C disconnects I was using before, but also not exactly ideal 
    since a user might want to end their message with "later" but not disconnect.

    After researching the threading library docs, I learned that there is 
    an option for the Thread object that makes it a daemon, which means 
    that the thread will exit if the main thread exits. This is a much better 
    practice because we no longer have to exit these threads before 
    exiting the program (which I wasn't doing in the first place: oops)
        I made the listen thread a daemon so that it would close with the main
        thread.

Server achievements: 
    I learned that a thread should return a value after it is done running, 
    otherwise python gets angry. So, I added a return value to the client thread 
    so that disconnected clients would have their thread closed. 

    The server also checks for this "later" keyword and breaks out of the 
    infinite loop of receiving messages if the client's message ends with it.
