This very small iteration contained a few changes:

Client changes:
    I started to use stdout instead of the plain print function
    in order to keep output consistent (my dreams of a pretty CLI
    were still kicking)

Server changes:
    I added mutex locks to the global variables in order to 
    prevent two threads from using the variables at the same time.
    This prevents any possible race conditions and other non-deterministic
    nightmares (though I never experienced one in development).
