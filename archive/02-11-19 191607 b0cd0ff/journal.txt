In this iteration, I fixed the broken pipe error from 
the last version, and made big progress in multi-threading the
server.

Client achievements:
    I moved around some of the socket code and fixed the broken
    pipe error: The while true loop for the listen thread works!
    
    The client has a bit of a nicer input prompt, and must wait one
    second before sending another message (this is implemented in 
    the client side, so technically they don't need to wait)

Server achievements:
    The server was completely rewritten.
    
    The server is now multi-threaded. The main thread listens 
    for new connections, and when a new connection is opened it 
    creates a 'client thread' that first waits for a message from 
    the client and then sends the message to the client.
