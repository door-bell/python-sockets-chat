This version only included changes in the server code.

Server:
    Properly check for duplicate nicknames
    Iterate through clients properly when broadcasting.
    Make broadcast thread a daemon. This thread is constantly running when
    the server is on, so it is convenient to not need to close the thread 
    when the server is closed.

    Re-factor command parsing so that we can get the arguments in a more 
    convenient way. 
    Implement a whisper command: Since we are now keeping track of 
    nicknames, we can send messages to specific sockets.
