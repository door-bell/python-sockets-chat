From the initial commit to this version, I used the following "guide" 
in supplement to my guide to get things up and running quickly:

I believe that this article contained some code that I used, but now 
for whatever reason I can't find it anywhere. I know that I used this 
guide because I included it in a commit message (9364838).
---------------------
Anyway, the main achievement in this iteration is that I learned to use 
the threading library to "listen" for messages from the server in the 
background while still taking input. However, the listen method is connecting 
to a socket from within a while true loop, so it's clearly not refined in any way.

At this point I was getting a 'broken pipe error' which probably 
had to do with the very broken while true loop.

An additional note: I realized that quitting the client program would 
result in the server getting flooded with empty messages. This is why 
the client_thread method checks "if not msg" in order to break out and 
close the socket if it detects the client quit the program / disconnected.
