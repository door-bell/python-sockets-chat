This version was where I finally came to a concrete 
form of my protocol. 

The client's first message to the server is still the desired 
nickname. The client will receive an "OK" message if the nickname is valid, 
and then any messages the clients send is now considered a message by the 
server. The main change is in the format of these messages.

Before, the client sent a nickname and a the text of the message with each 
message. This meant that someone could potentially send a message with someone 
else's nickname. 

BUT: now, the client only sends the text of their message. The server keeps track of 
who sent the messages by keeping the 'nickname' variable local to each client's 
individual thread.
